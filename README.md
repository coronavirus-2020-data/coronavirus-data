# coronavirus-data
This data file contains the total cases, total deaths, daily cases, and daily deaths of the top five counties of the top six COVID-19 infected states in the United States starting from April 1 to present. Additionally, this file also contains the total tests those states performed each day. As of May 27, there are five graphs plotted with respect to time of the daily cases of COVID-19. Throughout this pandemic, this file will be updated to compare more variables in hopes of eventually publishing a peer-review paper.

The data is in .xlsx for easy access to Excel users and a .csv form for easy importing into Pandas for data analysis.
