# coronavirus-data
This data file contains the total cases, total deaths, daily cases, and daily deaths of the top five counties of the top six COVID-19 infected states in the United States starting from April 1 to present. Additionally, this file also contains the total tests those states performed each day. As of May 27, there are five graphs plotted with respect to time of the daily cases of COVID-19. Throughout this pandemic, this file will be updated to compare more variables in hopes of eventually publishing a peer-review paper.

The data is in .xlsx for easy access to Excel users and a .csv form for easy importing into Pandas for data analysis.

Entry 1 (05.30.2020)

UPDATES
This update cleared up the contradicting data and negative values for growth in cases per county per state. Since this data is being collected from multiple sources, including using an internet archive finder to collect data when this project hadn't started, differences in time of data recorded resulted in these errors. However, all of that has been cleared and deleted, so the data seen is as accurate as possible. 

THOUGHTS
All states are progressing in reopening, and are moving up the stages and loosening the restrictions. I suspect that cases will rise steadily, as it is quite inevitable and may be the only way to end COVID-19 (develop immunity through minimal exposure). Additionally, protesting and riots are happening because of the BLM movement—though many are wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, I believe this exposure and large gatherings will result in fluctuating cases (give two weeks).

Entry 2 (05.31.20)

UPDATES
This update added data until May 30, and updated the graphs.

THOUGHTS
As a result of the rallies, protests, and looting going on in SoCal, specifically the Santa Monica protest and Long Beach protest, I think this will lead to an upsurge in COVID-19 cases. It's already observed that LA County and Orange County is increasing in cases incredibly fast because of looser restrictions, like the opening of beaches. Another note— the San Jose area (Santa Clara County) have many rallies and protests going on, with large gatherings of people. Additionally, Cupertino (Santa Clara County) is also organizing protests and there has been looting in Santana Row, Cupertino / San Jose's commercial district, which may lead to an upsurge in COVID-19 cases in NorCal.

Entry 3 (06.1.20)

UPDATES
This data now includes graphs comparing the sum of the positive cases of the top 6 counties per state compared to the total tests performed by the state. The purpose of this was to not only see the growth of testing in those states, but to see if the testing is getting more accurate

THOUGHTS
The overlapping bar graph which compares the State's negative and positive cases does not show that testing is getting more accurate—the positive cases are only a sliver of the entire State's testing that day. However, daily testing is growing, and the positive cases are shrinking, which shows that mass testing is more effective than specific testing.

Entry 4 (06.03.20)

UPDATES
- Changed overlapping bar graph to compare total state positive cases and negative cases, rather than the top 6 counties positives cases vs the entire state's negative cases. 
- Updated case count data to June 1 and updated all graphs

THOUGHTS
I'm interested to see how this data can provide meaning towards publishing a paper, regardless of how detailed/important the paper is. Also, during the summer I want to learn python because of its importance in data science.

Entry 5 (06.06.20)

UPDATES
- Updated all data to Jun-5, as well as their graphs
- So far, there are comparisons of the increase in case counts per county, negative vs positive tests in the entire state, and increase per top 5 counties per state

THOUGHTS
I'm going to start working on new deaths cases per county. Also, I've been thinking about how I'm going to write the research paper— I think there should include rough explanation behind the nature of COVID-19, like how it's transmitted, what it does to the body's immune system, why it's different from the flu, etc., and then take a few notable trends and discuss why, per say, this county has more deaths although it has fewer cases. I can then look into the resources available in the nearby hospitals in that county, if it's a rural / city area, if it's relatively poor or rich, etc., and elaborate from there and draw conclusions.

Entry 6 (06.12.20)

UPDATES
- Changed individual state + cases v. - cases to a sum of them
- Updated all data & graphs to June 10th

THOUGHTS
- I want to start a google doc on the timeline of reopening/phases per state. Thus, for example, I see that California's Orange County rescinded the "must wear mask in public" regulation on June 11th, so I would expect a rise in cases shown in my data starting from several days later (will know about specifics when learn more about coronavirus).

Entry 7 (06.20.20)

UPDATES
- Updated all data & graphs to June 17th
- Made graphs for each county's COVID-19 related deaths per day


THOUGHTS
- Instead of using the states' cumulative cases/deaths for graphs (besides the sum of positive cases v. total tests data set) I'm using the sum for the top 5 counties because I think it'll be easier to narrow down specifics, e.g. number of local hospitals, population, etc. which can be used to explain certain observations (like a state with not many positive cases, but more deaths than those of a state with more positive cases)
