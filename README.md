# coronavirus-data
This data file contains the total cases, total deaths, daily cases, and daily deaths of the top five counties of the top six COVID-19 infected states in the United States starting from April 1 to present. Additionally, this file also contains the total tests those states performed each day. As of May 27, there are five graphs plotted with respect to time of the daily cases of COVID-19. Throughout this pandemic, this file will be updated to compare more variables in hopes of eventually publishing a peer-review paper.

The data is in .xlsx for easy access to Excel users and a .csv form for easy importing into Pandas for data analysis.

UPDATES
This update cleared up the contradicting data and negative values for growth in cases per county per state. Since this data is being collected from multiple sources, including using an internet archive finder to collect data when this project hadn't started, differences in time of data recorded resulted in these errors. However, all of that has been cleared and deleted, so the data seen is as accurate as possible. 

THOUGHTS
All states are progressing in reopening, and are moving up the stages and loosening the restrictions. I suspect that cases will rise steadily, as it is quite inevitable and may be the only way to end COVID-19 (develop immunity through minimal exposure). Additionally, protesting and riots are happening because of the BLM movementâ€”though many are wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, I believe this exposure and large gatherings will result in fluctuating cases (give two weeks).
